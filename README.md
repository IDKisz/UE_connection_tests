## Tests of the code simulating connecting UE to base station


The project was implemented during the testing academy. It included checking the possibility of connecting to a simple software simulating a base station.

It was required to create test cases, keywords, variables and to show the results of the tests performed.

The code for testing was temporarily available - the telnetlib library was used for connection.
